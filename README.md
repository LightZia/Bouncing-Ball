📈 Graph Explanation: Bouncing Ball with Gravity and Restitution
This plot shows how a ball bounces under gravity, starting from a 2-meter height, with a coefficient of restitution 
𝑒
=
0.75
e=0.75. Each bounce loses energy:

The time between bounces grows shorter.

The height of each bounce decreases as

The steps indicate the parabolic rise and fall, simplified here into key points (top and bottom).
