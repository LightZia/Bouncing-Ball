The graph visually demonstrates how a bouncing ball loses height over time due to gravity and a non-perfect coefficient of restitution. It illustrates the physical principle that after each impact with the ground, the ball retains only a portion of its energy, causing progressively lower bounces. This helps in understanding real-world inelastic collisions and energy dissipation in motion under gravity.
